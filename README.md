## 🏆 Zawadi+ – Loyalty Rewards Tracker

**Zawadi+** is a joyful, lightweight loyalty rewards app for small local businesses like salons, barbershops, and eateries. Built during the **Vibe Coding Hackathon**, it tracks customer visits and rewards loyalty after 5 visits. No logins. No servers. Just pure joy. 🌟

### 🔧 Features

* ✅ Tracks visits by customer phone number
* 🎁 Rewards after 5 visits (with a fun popup!)
* 🧠 Smart memory using browser localStorage
* 🎨 Clean, mobile-friendly UI with cheerful theme
* ⚡ Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No frameworks!)

### 🧪 How It Works

1. Enter a customer’s phone number.
2. Tap **“Add Visit”** to log the visit.
3. On the 5th visit, the customer earns a reward! 🎉
4. Visit count resets and starts over.

Each phone number is tracked individually. Switching between numbers will resume each customer’s unique progress.
